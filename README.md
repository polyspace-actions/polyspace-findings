# Action for Reviewing Polyspace Analysis Results

The [polyspace-findings](#polyspace-findings) action enables you to add information about Polyspace&reg; analysis findings to your commit when you push changes to the repository or to your pull request. The action supports only [self-hosted](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) runners.

## Examples


### Add Analysis Results as Annotation in Your Commit

Use this action to start an analysis every time you push your changes to any branch on the repository. Polyspace then shows the results as annotations in the pull request.

```yaml
name: Run Polyspace analysis on PR
on: [push]
  branches:
    - '**' #All branches
jobs:
  my-job:
    name: Run analysis
    runs-on: self-hosted

    steps:
    - name: Check out repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Generate compilation database
      uses: cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON .
    - name: Analyze pull request
      uses: polyspace-actions/polyspace-bug-finder@23.2.0
      with:
        compilation-database-file: compile_commands.json
        checkers-file: checkers.xml
        sarif-file: results.sarif

    - name: Annotate the findings to the commit
      uses: polyspace-actions/polyspace-findings@23.2.0
      with:
        sarif-file: results.sarif
```
## polyspace-findings

When you define your workflow in the `.github/workflows` folder of your repository, specify this action as `polyspace-actions/polyspace-findings@23.2.0`.

The action accepts these inputs. Unless otherwise specified, the inputs are optional.

Input                     | Description
------------------------- | ---------------
|`sarif-file`|Path of the generated SARIF file. The default name of the results file is `results.sarif`.|
|`github-token`| Access token generated by Github for authentication in the workflow job. Polyspace uses the token to authenticate when adding annotations to a commit. The default value for this input is `${{ github.token }}`. This input is mandatory.|
|`set-commit-status`|When you set this input to `true`, Polyspace sets the status of the commit to PASS if there are no findings or FAIL if the SARIF results file contains findings. The default value of this input is `true`.|
|`comment-commit-findings`| When you set this input to `true`, Polyspace adds a comment under the commit. Polyspace also adds each result finding as an annotation on the line of code where the finding occurs in the diff view. The default value of this input is `true`.|
|`review-status`| Type of review posted in a pull request. Valid values are `REQUEST_CHANGES` or `COMMENT`. The default value of this input is `COMMENT`.|
|`comment-pull-request-findings`| When you set this input to `true`, Polyspace adds analysis findings to the pull request as reviews. Since new pulls requests do not overwrite previous reviews, the diff view might end up containing many findings. The default value of this input is `false`.|
|`pull-request-number`| Pull request number that the analysis runs on. This input evaluates to none if the action runs in a different context. If you do not specify a pull request number, the action uses the default value `${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`.|
